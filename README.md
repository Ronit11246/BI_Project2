# Google Fiber Customer Service Dashboard

# Data Used:

This project utilizes customer service data from Google Fiber to create a comprehensive dashboard. The data includes information on repeat calls, call cadence, call types, markets, and problem types. The dataset provides insights into customer behavior and allows for analysis of customer service performance.

# Summary of Findings:

**The Google Fiber Customer Service Dashboard provides valuable insights into customer call patterns and performance metrics. The dashboard includes visualizations and tables that highlight key findings, such as:**

1. Call Cadence: The first tab of the dashboard visualizes the number of repeat calls received each month. It showcases the trend of customer calls after their initial contact, providing insights into customer engagement and the effectiveness of customer support.

2. First Contact Calls: The dashboard also visualizes the percentage of first contact calls by the day of the week. This helps identify patterns in customer behavior, such as the most common day for customers to reach out for the first time.

3. Types of Calls: The second tab of the dashboard presents tables that allow stakeholders to explore different types of calls by date and categorizes calls by market and problem type. This provides a deeper understanding of the specific markets that generate the most calls and the common problems that prompt repeat calls.

4. Market and Problem Analysis: The "Market and Type for First Repeat Calls" section further visualizes problem types that generate the most repeat calls across different markets. This analysis helps identify areas of improvement and potential solutions to reduce repeat calls.

5. Quarterly Performance: The final tab of the dashboard displays charts that showcase the number of day 0 calls and first repeat calls across markets and problem types for the first quarter of the year. This enables users to identify trends and patterns in call volumes, market-specific issues, and the effectiveness of customer service efforts.


**The Google Fiber Customer Service Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of customer service performance, allowing stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and improve customer support strategies. This GitHub repository contains the code and files necessary to reproduce the dashboard and explore the data further.**
